(Outlier robust) NLLS Calibration for PHOS, ALICE, CERN.

Requires the ROOT libraray.
( To use the sample extractor, ALIROOT & alien is also needed
and ROOT needs to be compiled with alien support. )

To get/build/install ROOT (without full ALIROOT/alien support):
1. check out root, 
    $ svn co http://root.cern.ch/svn/root/tags/v5-30-03 [local-path]
2. configure
    $ cd {local-path}
    $ ./configure
3. build
    $ make
4. test
    $ cd test
    $ make
    $ ./stress
    $ ./stressHepix

To build the calib project,
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ cmake ..
 $ make
( make sure root-config is found in PATH !!!)

to run extractor localy use
sample/local/runLocal.C
It requires a file named files.txt with a list of paths to local ESDs
